# Python_machineLearning_examples

In this repository, I will include examples in Python applying machine learning techniques to publicly available datasets. Steps involved range from data wrangling, data exploratory, data treatment, variable selection to modeling and results diagnostics. 

The first example is working with California housing dataset applying logistic and Gradient Boosting methods.
